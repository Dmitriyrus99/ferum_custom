# Audit & Modernization Reports

This folder stores technical audit reports, risk maps, and modernization phase deliverables.

Naming conventions:

- `YYYY-MM-DD_audit.md` — point-in-time audit snapshot.
- `phase_<N>_<topic>.md` — phase deliverables (design, implementation notes, validation results, risks).

Rules:

- Do **not** include secrets or real tokens/keys in any report.
- Prefer checklists, tables, and reproducible commands.
